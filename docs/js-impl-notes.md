Based on the code, I can explain how findings are combined in this codebase. There are several levels where information is combined:

1. Initial Query Combination:
In `run.ts`, the code combines the initial user query with follow-up questions and answers into a single combined query:
```typescript
const combinedQuery = `
Initial Query: ${initialQuery}
Follow-up Questions and Answers:
${followUpQuestions.map((q, i) => `Q: ${q}\nA: ${answers[i]}`).join('\n')}
`;
```

2. Research Results Combination:
In `deep-research.ts`, the combining of findings happens in multiple ways:

a. At each research level:
```typescript
const allLearnings = [...learnings, ...newLearnings.learnings];
const allUrls = [...visitedUrls, ...newUrls];
```
This combines the existing learnings with new learnings from each search query.

b. Final combination of parallel research paths:
```typescript
return {
    learnings: [...new Set(results.flatMap(r => r.learnings))],
    visitedUrls: [...new Set(results.flatMap(r => r.visitedUrls))],
};
```
This combines results from all parallel search queries, using `flatMap` to flatten the array of results and `Set` to remove duplicates.

3. Final Report Generation:
The combined findings are then used to generate a final report in the `writeFinalReport` function:
```typescript
const learningsString = trimPrompt(
    learnings
      .map(learning => `<learning>\n${learning}\n</learning>`)
      .join('\n'),
    150_000,
);
```

The system works recursively with a breadth and depth parameter:
- Breadth: Controls how many parallel queries are made at each level
- Depth: Controls how many levels deep the research goes

At each level:
1. It generates SERP (Search Engine Results Page) queries based on the current state
2. Processes those results to extract learnings
3. Generates follow-up questions
4. If there's more depth to go, it recursively researches those follow-up questions
5. All findings are combined upward through the recursion tree

The combination process ensures that:
- Duplicate findings are removed (using Set)
- All sources (URLs) are tracked
- The research follows multiple paths but brings everything together in a coherent way
- The final report includes all discovered information organized in a readable format

This architecture allows the system to explore multiple research directions simultaneously while maintaining a coherent collection of all discover
ed information.
